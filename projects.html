        <p>Creating our GitHub accounts was our first project, and this is how I created mine:</p>
        <p>Firstly I created a github account that can be easily done without any experience. Secondly we have to create a repository. In this we have to get a domain name which i chose dorukersoy34. After this we have successfully created our first github repository. We can click onto our domain name and see an empty page that we can fill in later. 
In our repository we will go ahead and create a readme site in our repository . it's already in the application it's set up for you we just have to open that . afterwards we could use templates to make our readme look better or we could just keep it simple for a while. For me I kept it simple and have no template that is in my repository. After I created a few links that I also can edit inside. I got all the extra links that i have created and put them to my readme so that all the things that i have put in those links are reachable from the repository that is public.
