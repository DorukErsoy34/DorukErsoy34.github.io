Collaboration

Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the divercity of talents and 
perspectives of those who designed it.

Interpersonal skills needed for collaboration
Communication
Consensus building
Conflict resolution
Negotiation
If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together

Online tools:
Repl.it-multiplayer
GitHub- collaboration and repository

Program functions and purpose

Why does the computing innovation exist?
What problem does the computing innovation solve?
What does the computing innovation allow us to do that to we couldn’t do before?

Binary

Prefix = “dec” = ten
Prefix = “bi” = two
It’s a number system that uses 0 and 1
Binary digit (bit) - the smallest unit of data in computing
Byte - group of eight bits

Digital data and abstractions

Analog: mechanism, device, or technology that represents data by measurement of a continuous physical variable

Use of digital data to work approximate real world analog data is an example of abstraction

How do you send piece of analog data with a simple binary on/off switch?

The more we have the more interiors that can be represented


How compression works

Larger data file the more that can be pulled out of it
Data compression methods:
Lossless:
Reduces the number of bits, stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of original data
Lossy:
Significantly reduces the number of bits, stored or transmitted, but only allow reconstruction often appropriate
            of original data.


Data Abstraction: Data abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex real-world entities into 
            manageable representations by focusing on their essential characteristics while hiding 
            unnecessary details.
Key Term: List: Definition: A list is a collection of elements that are ordered and can be accessed by their
            position. It is similar to a shopping list where items are listed in a specific order and can be 
            referred to by their number.
Strings: In programming, strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotation marks. They are used to
            represent text and allow manipulation of words, sentences, or any other textual information within 
            a program.
Variable: A variable is a named storage location in computer memory that holds a value which can change 
            during program execution. It allows programmers to store and manipulate different types of data 
            throughout their code.
            
Arithmetic Operators: Arithmetic operators are symbols used in programming languages to perform mathematical 
            calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder).
Iteration: Iteration refers to the repetition of a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. It 
            allows programs to perform tasks repeatedly without having to write repetitive code.
MOD operator: The MOD operator, short for modulus, is a mathematical operation that returns the remainder when one 
            number is divided by another.
Modulo operator: The modulo operator, represented by the symbol %, is a mathematical operation that returns the 
            remainder when one number is divided by another.
Pseudocode: Pseudocode is a simplified programming language that uses plain English to outline the logic of a 
            program. It helps programmers plan and organize their code before writing it in an actual programming 
            language.
Selection: Selection refers to the process of making a decision based on a condition or criteria. It allows the 
            program to choose between different paths of execution.
Sequencing: Sequencing refers to the order in which code statements are executed. It determines the flow of a 
            program, with each statement being executed one after another.
            
            Boolean variables can only represent the values true or false. 
            Relational operators are used with Boolean values to test the relationship between two values
Boolean values are also used with logical operators known as NOT, AND and OR. These can be used to combine 
            multiple conditions, whereas relational operators can only evaluate one condition.Variables are used in 
            programming to store values, such as numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings. They can be updated, and 
            the "←" operator assigns values to them. This makes it easy to manage and reuse data in a program. Data 
            abstraction simplifies how data is handled by focusing on its use rather than its details. For 
            instance, lists and strings use an index—a number that refers to a specific element within them. 
            This abstraction helps make programs easier to write and maintain.
Algorithms, which are step-by-step processes to solve problems, can be expressed in natural language,
            diagrams, or pseudocode. They rely on three key principles: sequence (performing steps in order), 
            selection (making choices), and iteration (repeating actions). Strings, which are sequences of 
            characters, are used to represent text like words or sentences. They can be manipulated by combining,
            splitting, or searching. A substring is simply a part of a string that can be extracted or 
            modified as needed.
Boolean expressions evaluate to either true (1) or false (0) and are often used in decision-making. Logical 
            operators like AND, OR, and NOT combine these expressions to create complex conditions. Conditionals, 
            such as if, else if, and else, allow programs to make decisions based on these Boolean conditions. For 
            example, if a condition is true, the program performs a specific action; otherwise, it evaluates other 
            conditions or takes a default action. Nested conditionals occur when one conditional is placed inside another, 
            allowing programs to handle more complex decision-making processes.
