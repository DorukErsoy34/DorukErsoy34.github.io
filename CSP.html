Collaboration

Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and 
perspectives of those who designed it.

Interpersonal skills needed for collaboration
Communication
Consensus building
Conflict resolution
Negotiation
If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together

Online tools:
Repl.it - multiplayer
GitHub - collaboration and repository

Program functions and purpose

Why does the computing innovation exist?
What problem does the computing innovation solve?
What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we couldn’t do before?

Binary

Prefix = “dec” = ten
Prefix = “bi” = two
It’s a number system that uses 0 and 1
Binary digit (bit) - the smallest unit of data in computing
Byte - group of eight bits

Digital data and abstractions

Analog: mechanism, device, or technology that represents data by measurement of a continuous physical variable

Use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of abstraction

How do you send a piece of analog data with a simple binary on/off switch?

The more we have, the more intervals can be represented

How compression works

Larger data file, the more that can be pulled out of it
Data compression methods:
Lossless:
Reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of original data
Lossy:
Significantly reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allows approximate reconstruction of original data.

Data Abstraction: Data abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex real-world entities into 
manageable representations by focusing on their essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details.
        
Key Terms:
- List: A collection of elements that are ordered and can be accessed by their position.
- Strings: Sequences of characters enclosed in quotation marks.
- Variable: A named storage location in computer memory that holds a value which can change during execution.
- Arithmetic Operators: Symbols for mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
- Iteration: Repetition of a set of instructions until a specific condition is met.
- MOD operator: Returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.
- Pseudocode: A simplified language using plain English to outline program logic.
- Selection: The process of making a decision based on a condition or criteria.
- Sequencing: The order in which code statements are executed.

Boolean variables can only represent true or false values, often used with relational and logical operators.
