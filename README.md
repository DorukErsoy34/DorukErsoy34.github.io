Home CSP Projects Coding in swift
</p>
Hello, my name is Doruk, and I am currently a 10th-grade student at Hisar Schools. I have a strong passion for technology and have chosen CSP (Computer Science Principles) as part of my academic path because I am eager to learn how to code and deepen my understanding of how technology shapes our world. Learning to code is something I see as not just a skill, but a way of thinking that can open up countless opportunities in today's digital age.
Beyond academics, I believe in a well-rounded life, which is reflected in my various hobbies. I enjoy playing tennis, which helps me stay active and focused. Exploring new places and traveling are also passions of mine, as I love discovering different cultures and gaining new perspectives. Additionally, I have a creative side that I express through music—I play the drums and find it to be a great outlet for both creativity and relaxation.
I am excited to continue growing in both my academic and personal interests, always striving to push my boundaries and explore new possibilities.

Hello! My name is Doruk, a 10th-grade student at Hisar Schools with a passion for technology. I’m currently studying CSP (Computer Science Principles) to dive deeper into coding and the role of technology in shaping the future. Coding, to me, is more than just a skill—it's a mindset for unlocking opportunities in today’s digital world.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I lead a balanced lifestyle. I enjoy playing tennis, exploring new places, and traveling to discover diverse cultures. Music is another creative outlet for me, especially drumming, which brings both relaxation and expression.
